@AoA - array of arrays. AoA[][]. The first set is the cell id in row, column, box. 
       For example. Counted in right to left from top left. For example AoA[2][0] 
       would be the third cell and printing AoA[2][0] would give 020. For 0 row, 2 
       column, 0 box. 

cherry - when a cell has only one possible value


$daddy_y - global variable that represents the cell number

AoA[x][0] = Cell Id
AoA[x][1] = hard value or zero
AoA[x][2] = 99 if hard value, 0 otherwise





open game file or die
populate AoA[][] 
populate hard values
	if AoA[x][1] > 0, then set AoA[x][2] to 99
while there are cherries
	iterate thru AoA
	





allowed()
gets as input $daddy_y
create @temp_array that is set to 1-9
split AoA[$daddy_y][0] and get $row, $col, $box
iterate thru AoA
	- will find all cells that match the same row, col and box of the cell being 
          looked at.
        - if find a number in row, col or box, set that position in @temp_array to zero, 
          so when finished @temp_array will have zeros and where a number was found and 
          what is left is what are possible values.
